Wolfgang Schäuble waited. The lights above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were terrorists in Germany. He didn't see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Chancler Merkel were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.
Wolfgang was Minister of the Interior for three years. When he was young he watched the police arrest RAF members and he said to dad "I want to be in the government daddy."
Dad said "No! You will BE KILL BY TERRORISTS"
There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the anti-terror command center of the Reichstag he knew there were terrorists.
"This is Merkel" the radio crackered. "You must fight the terrorists!"
So Wolfgang gotted in his wheelchair and tapped everybodys phone lines.
"HE GOING TO KILL US" said the terrorists
"I will blow him up" said the muslim and got into his car.
Wolfgang revokered his rights and tried to arrested him. But then the wheelchair fell over and he was trapped and not able to invade privacy.
"No! I must read the terrorists emails" he shouted
The radio said "No, Wolfgang. You are the terrorists"
And then Schäuble was a nazi.
