What you're referring to as Bernd, is in fact, GNU/Bernd, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Bernd. Bernd is not an troll unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU troll made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital troll components comprising a full troll as defined by POSIX.
