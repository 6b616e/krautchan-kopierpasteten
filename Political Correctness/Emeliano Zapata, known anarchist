A leechlike union boss and mafia stooge was teaching a class on Emeliano Zapata, known anarchist.

At this moment, an innovative, self-reliant Pinkerton Detective who had broken up 1500 strikes and understood the necessity of economic freedom and the concentration of wealth in the hands of the already wealthy stood up and held up a lump of coal.

"How much is this coal worth?"

The arrogant union thug smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied "whatever it cost the labourer to mine it."

"Incorrect. Thanks to the teachings of the Austrian School we know that everything is worth what you are willing to pay for it, no more, no less"

The union leech was visibly shaken and dropped his copy of The Conquest of Bread. He stormed out of the room crying those Liberal crocodile tears.

The students applauded and all registered to join the Libertarian Party that day and accepted Milton Friedman as their personal saviour. An eagle named 'free trade' flew into the room and shed a tear on a dollar bill. Capitalism and Freedom was read several times and David Ricardo himself showed up and privatised all prisons across the country.

Enjoy McDonalds!
