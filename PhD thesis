Hi /b/,

I'm finishing my PhD thesis at the university of Vienna. As the main part of my sociological studies, I analyzed the creation and death of memes. This board and it's contributors have been one of my most important empirical sources.

So I just wanted to thank you for your unbeknown cooperation.

btw, the chart I included is from my publication in the Journal of Classical Sociology. It depicts the lifespan (a little more than two months) of an average internet mem. However, successor mems take about 25% of the original mem (1st generation), and so on. So the sixth offspring mem generation after ~180 days inherited about 24% of the original mem.

Please keep in mind that these are averages!

And now a word of advice: as part of a longitudinal analysis, my predecessor has started to research the life achievements of heavy internet users, and I continued the survey. Boards like these are mostly frequented by lower class teenagers, and predict a further social decline. More than 80% of you will end up in the first (lowest) tax bracket quartile. So don't ge me wrong, but leave this board and instead become a productive member of society.
